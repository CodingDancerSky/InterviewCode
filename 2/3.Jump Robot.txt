Jump Robot 

Problem
You have developed a jump robot.

This jump robot can perform N different types of jumps.

When the robot performs the ith type of jump, it can jump to the point di meters north, south, east, or west from the current position.

Calculate the number of the points where the robot can reach under the conditions that the start point is specified and it can perform each type of jump only once.

The start point is included in the points where the robot can reach.

Even if the jump type is different, the jump distance might be the same. In other words, i≠j and di=dj can be true at the same time. Even if the jump distance is the same, as long as the jump type is different, the robot can perform each jump once.

Input
Input is given from the standard input in the format shown below:

N
d1
d2
:
dN
1. In the first line, an integer N(1≦N≦30), which indicates the number of the jump types that the jump robot can perform, is given.
2. In the following N lines, the ith line contains an integer di(1≦di≦10), which indicates the jump distance of the ith jump type, is given.

Output
Output the number of the points where the jump robot can reach in a single line.

Write output to the standard output and insert LF at the end of the line.
