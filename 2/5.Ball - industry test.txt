Question
Given 8 balls aligned horizontally and numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 from left to right. We are going to perform the following N operations in the given order.

Exchange A1th ball from the left and B1th ball from the left.
Exchange A2th ball from the left and B2th ball from the left.
:
Exchange ANth ball from the left and BNth ball from the left.
This series of N operations stated above will be one set.

Your task is to output the ultimate arrangement of these balls after repeating K sets.

Input
Input will be given in the following format from Standard Input:

N K
A1 B1
A2 B2
:
AN BN
1. On the 1st line, integer N(1≦N≦50) represents the number of operations that are included in one set, and integer K(1≦K≦109) represents the number of sets. They are separated with a space.
2.On the following N lines, the operations to perform are given. Each line contains two integers Ai, Bi(1≦Ai, Bi≦8, Ai≠Bi) that represent the exchanges to be made. They are separated with a space.

Input Example #1
4 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1
Output Example #1
1 4 2 3 5 6 7 8
You will perform 2 sets of 4 given operations, so you will perform 8 operations in total.

The flow of the operation is the following:

First, the balls are arranged as '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8'.
One will exchange the 1st ball from the left and the 2nd ball from the left. After this operation, the balls are arranged as '2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8'.
One will exchange the 2nd ball from the left and the 3rd ball from the left. After this operation, the balls are arranged as '2 3 1 4 5 6 7 8'.
One will exchange the 3rd ball from the left and the 4th ball from the left. After this operation, the balls are arranged as '2 3 4 1 5 6 7 8'.
One will exchange the 4th ball from the left and the 1st ball from the left. After this operation, the balls are arranged as '1 3 4 2 5 6 7 8'.
One will exchange the 1st ball from the left and the 2nd ball from the left. After this operation, the balls are arranged as '3 1 4 2 5 6 7 8'.
One will exchange the 2nd ball from the left and the 3rd ball from the left. After this operation, the balls are arranged as '3 4 1 2 5 6 7 8'.
One will exchange the 3rd ball from the left and the 4th ball from the left. After this operation, the balls are arranged as '3 4 2 1 5 6 7 8'.
One will exchange the 4th ball from the left and the 1st ball from the left. After this operation, the balls are arranged as '1 4 2 3 5 6 7 8'.
